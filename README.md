# !! Important Information !!
The date that I started creating and developing this project started on **March 25th, 2025**, in the midst of the **Department of Education** being shut down. This will not deter the creation nor the finalization of this project, as I will do my best to present the information as is.


This `README.md` will be updated with more documentation as I progress with my studies.

`university_scraper_50mile.py` is meant to be a baseline scraping tool to get all basic attributes of the Universities (University Location, Distance from ZIP, General Information (phone number), Type, Awards Offered, Campus Setting, Campus Housing, Student Population, Student-to-faculty Ratio, as well as the IPEDS IDs and OPE IDs)
